# Set up and build android AAOS for Pixel 4a - stream on/offline data from remotiveLabs cloud

This guide is basically a copy of https://source.android.com/docs/devices/automotive/start/pixelxl, but first new version of git and repo are fetched.

```

>Flashing can be tricky even if following the guide. When using fastboot it doesn't go to homescreen, however, `adb root`, `adb remount` and `adb sync` works. Once the automotive binaries are in place it does boot properly to homescreen

## Build and replace grpc-service

Put the code in for example: `aaos_on_phone/vendor/remotivelabs/grpc-service`, like so:
```
~/aaos_on_phone/vendor/remotivelabs/grpc-service$ cp -r ~/remotivelabs-android-vhal .
```

Unless already done you should do:

```
# from aaos_on_phone folder
. build/envsetup.sh
lunch aosp_sunfish_car	
```
build by doing:
```
m grpc-service
```
On the device, unless it has already been done since last boot
```
adb root && sleep 5 &&  adb remount
```
Copy to the pixel 4a by doing:
```
adb sync
```

Make sure the network is available

Start the `grpc-service`:

```
adb shell /system_ext/bin/grpc-service vhal-robert-beamydemo2-jnjbmq2tja-ez.a.run.app API_KEY
```
Make sure the credentials match, go to the `cloud.remotivelabs.com`, and start the recording, click play.

To see output in log
```
adb logcat | grep grpc
```
To see the signals in Kitchen Sink selinux needs to be set to permissive on top of `adb root`. This needs to be done after each reboot.
```
adb shell setenforce 0
```
Dicslaimer: VHAL crashes when the grpc-service is closed. I've tried to close the socker properly but it didn't help. Can'f find a way on how to fix this from the socket client, probably we need to patch VHAL to make it behave nice.

In your pixel you can now start KITCHEN SINK and navigate to PROPERTY TEST and select relevant signals such as `PERF_STEERING_ANGLE` or `PERF_VEHICLE_SPEED`

You should now see the following. If the app reports "Failed to get VHAL property" force quitting KITCHEN SINK helps.
